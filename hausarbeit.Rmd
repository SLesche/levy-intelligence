# Introduction
- Intelligence and mental speed

- but what parts of mental speed? Variability aswell?

- DDM and its contribution to intelligence

- extension to levy-flight

- hypothesis about alpha and intelligence
 
- Aim of this study?

# Methods

## Data
Data originally from...
## Participants
Take the following from the original study
## Tasks

### Hick Task

### Posner Task

### Sternberg Task

## Procedure

## Analysis
### Levy-Flight Model
Params of Bayesflow here

### Structural Equation Model
General model

# Results
## Model evaluation

## Bivariate relationship

## SEM

# Discussion
Low correlations, but negative direction. Need to extend this to more difficult tasks. (Sternberg may already be a difficult task)

maybe in the ongoing variability discussion
